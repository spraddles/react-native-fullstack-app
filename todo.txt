To do:
-signup: email
-signup: socials
-login: email
-login: socials
-pix 'key' unique number (chavealeatoria)
-persist state
-reset state on cancel (in new user flow)
-authentication


Bugs:
-email login + signup: validate fields & catch blank fields
-inputs have errors by default, change this
-forgot password (for email method)
-profile page scroll up bug when editing field (same with Transfer page)
-user can tap directly into other inputs bypassing validation logic
-fix styling for each transaction top & bottom borders in list
-add canMakePayment function to catch potential device payment issues
-add canLoginVia (google, apple, etc.) function to catch potential device login issues


Wishlist:
-send copy of receipt via email
-qr code scan for pix key
-add email confirmation for email signups
-add info icons / buttons to explain (things like) why certain fields are needed, etc.


Feedback:
-there is also a random code to transfer pix (chavealeatoria)
-extra fields on confirm page: institution, agency (branch), conte corrente (acct. no.)
