add RLS to card_transactions table
fix email signup (or remove)
update fees inputs & recalculate them
test other pix key options (phone, email, key)
fix confirm_transaction (replace with stripe API)









Wishlist:
-android app for 40% of all users
-send copy of transaction receipt via email
-add server logging for app (user session? probably already tracked by supabase)
-qr code scan for pix key
-add email confirmation for email signups
-let users change their email (how does this work with social logins)
-add info icons / buttons to explain (things like) why certain fields are needed, etc.
-home screen should be transactions + add a button for new payment
-add logout button (clear all state)
-user_meta add device meta like phone type + os version
