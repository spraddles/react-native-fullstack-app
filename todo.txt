To do

-merge branches

-mock out fake payment flow (incl. check token)
> trigger a "session cleanup" (composable?) flow on bad token: error message ('your session has expired'), logout, back to login

> dummy transaction request
> move transactionMethods to backend
> (done) custom fetch query
> remove serverAuth()


Mobile:
-sign up to expo & test build on testflight
> setup apple developer account
> configure expo to build apple app
> deploy app to testflight


Bugs:
-[AuthApiError: Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found], solve with AsyncStorage.clear()
-inputs have errors by default, change this
-add contact support ability
-security: only only users to read/write their own data, not others
-display error toast message when not connected to the internet
-handle transaction errors (in transactionMethods) so users cant continue if db field write/update is incorrect (see editProfile + newUserEditProfile)
-add profile loading status (like transaction history)
-email login + signup: validate fields & catch blank fields
-forgot password (for email method)
-fix styling for pix method tabs, make responsive right now its fixed width
-add canMakePayment function to catch potential device payment issues
-add canLoginVia (google, apple, etc.) function to catch potential device login issues
-collect errors & log them online


Wishlist:
-android app for 40% of all users
-send copy of transaction receipt via email
-add server logging for app
-qr code scan for pix key
-add email confirmation for email signups
-let users change their email (how does this work with social logins)
-add info icons / buttons to explain (things like) why certain fields are needed, etc.
-home screen should be transactions + add a button for new payment
-add logout button (clear all state)
-user_meta add device meta like phone type + os version
