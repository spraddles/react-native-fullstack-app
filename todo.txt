To do:


add/update fields:
-nationality
> dropdown picker component
> pass countries-list data into it

record flow of screens & send to caroline

remove seeder, and script method


Pipeline:
-sign up to expo & test build on testflight
> setup apple developer account
> configure expo to build apple app
> deploy app to testflight


Bugs:
-add contact support ability
-security: only only users to read/write their own data, not others
-display error toast message when not connected to the internet
-handle transaction errors (in transactionMethods) so users cant continue if db field write/update is incorrect (see editProfile + newUserEditProfile)
-add profile loading status (like transaction history)
-email login + signup: validate fields & catch blank fields
-inputs have errors by default, change this
-forgot password (for email method)
-profile page scroll up bug when editing field (same with Transfer page)
-fix styling for each transaction top & bottom borders in list
-fix styling for pix method tabs, make responsive right now its fixed width
-add canMakePayment function to catch potential device payment issues
-add canLoginVia (google, apple, etc.) function to catch potential device login issues
-collect errors & log them online
-seeder decision, use supabase or local db for dev environment


Wishlist:
-android app for 40% of all users
-send copy of transaction receipt via email
-add server logging for app
-qr code scan for pix key
-add email confirmation for email signups
-let users change their email (how does this work with social logins)
-add info icons / buttons to explain (things like) why certain fields are needed, etc.
-home screen should be transactions + add a button for new payment
-add logout button (clear all state)
-user_meta add device meta like phone type + os version


Feedback:
-there is also a random code to transfer pix (chavealeatoria)
-extra fields on confirm page: institution, agency (branch), conte corrente (acct. no.)
